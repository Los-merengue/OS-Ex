# Translating Virtual Address to Physical Address:

The translation of virtual addresses to physical addresses is a fundamental part of virtual memory 
systems. It allows the operating system to manage and optimize memory usage efficiently.
In a virtual memory system, programs and processes use virtual addresses, which are generated by the 
CPU. These virtual addresses need to be mapped to physical addresses in the RAM for actual data 
retrieval.


# Page Table:

A page table is a data structure used by the operating system to manage the mapping of virtual 
addresses to physical addresses.
The page table stores information about the correspondence between each virtual page 
(a fixed-size chunk of virtual memory) and a physical frame in RAM. It typically contains details 
such as the base address of the frame and access permissions.

# Page Fault:

A page fault occurs when a program or process attempts to access a virtual page that is not currently 
loaded in physical memory (RAM).
When a page fault occurs, the operating system needs to bring the required page into memory from 
secondary storage (like a hard drive). This process is called page-in.

# Page-In and Page-Out Operations:

Page-In: This is the process of loading a page from secondary storage into physical memory (RAM) when a 
page fault occurs. The OS selects a page to be evicted from memory to make space for the required page.
Page-Out: This operation is the opposite of page-in. It involves writing a page from physical memory 
back to secondary storage (like a swap file) to free up space for other pages. It occurs when memory is 
over-committed, and the OS needs to swap pages in and out to manage limited physical memory.

# Page Offset:

The page offset is the lower-order bits of a virtual address that determine the specific location within 
a page.
The page offset represents the position of the desired data within the page, and it is used to calculate 
the memory address within the physical frame in RAM.

# Demand Paging:

Demand paging is a memory management technique used by modern operating systems. It allows a program's 
pages to be loaded into physical memory only when they are needed, i.e., on-demand.
With demand paging, not all of a program's pages need to be loaded into RAM at once, which conserves 
memory. Pages are brought into memory when a page fault occurs and are evicted when memory is required 
for other purposes.

## Translation LookAside Buffer

This is a type of memory cache that stores recent translations of virtual memory to physical addresses
to enable faster retrieval
This high-speed cache is set up to keep track recently used page table entries (PTEs)
